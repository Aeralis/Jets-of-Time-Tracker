# Jets-of-Time-Tracker

A [Chrono Trigger: Jets of Time](https://ctjot.com) tracker pack for [PopTracker](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker), with autotracking.

## Usage

Download a .zip (or .tar.gz) from [the Releases page](
https://github.com/Aeralis/Jets-of-Time-Tracker/releases).

Extract this into your PopTracker packs directory per [PopTracker "Getting started"](
https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker#getting-started).

### Variants

This tracker pack includes several variants:

* Map Tracker: item and map tracker for Standard mode
* Item Tracker: item-only tracker for Standard mode
* Map Tracker (Legacy of Cyrus): item and map tracker for Legacy of Cyrus mode
* Item Tracker (Legacy of Cyrus): item-only tracker for Legacy of Cyrus mode

Each pack supports a "Broadcast View" which opens another smaller window

Additional flags (such as Chronosanity, Epoch Fail, etc.) can be enabled in
the "Settings" popup. Most of these will only affect map trackers (adding
additional spots to check or changing logic for location accessibility).

### Autotracking
